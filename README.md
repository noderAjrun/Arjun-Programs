# Arjun-Programs
I will create (ONLY THE CODE WITHOUT WEB-HOSTING) for a website: Arjun Programs



Hi everyone if you neeed to see the results of my code, you can download the project and paste it into your notepad/Text Edit
If you are using Ubuntu i prefer using Visual Studio Code which you can find in the Search option by typing in it, "red" or "Visual Studio Code".


Please save the following files with the given file-types:

1) index        - .html
2) app          - .js
3) Stylesheet   - .css

If you download the files you will have to change the location of the script and the stylesheet which are located in the index.html file in the <head></head> section.


Enjoy!!!
